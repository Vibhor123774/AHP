            A business valuation is the process of determining the economic
            value of a business entity. A business valuation, sometimes referred
            to as a company valuation, is the systematic assessment of the
            economic worth of a corporation. Throughout the valuation process, a
            comprehensive analysis is conducted on all aspects of a corporation
            in order to ascertain its value as well as the value of its
            individual departments or divisions. A company valuation is used to
            ascertain the equitable worth of a firm for several purposes, such
            as determining its selling value, establishing ownership among
            partners, assessing taxes, and even in divorce procedures. Owners
            sometimes seek the assistance of experienced business assessors to
            get an impartial assessment of the firm's worth.

            1. Market Capitalization Market capitalization is the most
            straightforward approach of assessing the value of a corporation.
            The calculation involves the multiplication of the company's share
            price by the total number of shares it has issued. As of January 3,
            2018, the stock price of Microsoft Inc. was $86.35. The company's
            valuation may be calculated by multiplying the total number of
            outstanding shares, which is 7.715 billion, by the share price of
            $86.35. This results in a valuation of $666.19 billion.

            2. Times Revenue Method The Times Revenue Method is a valuation
            technique that calculates the value of a company by multiplying its
            revenue by a certain factor. The times revenue business valuation
            approach involves applying a multiplier to a stream of revenues
            earned during a certain timeframe, with the multiplier being
            determined by the industry and economic conditions. As an example, a
            technology business may have a valuation that is three times its
            sales, but a service organisation may have a valuation that is half
            its revenue.

            3. Price-to-earnings ratio Instead of using the Times- revenue
            approach, one may use the earnings multiplier to get a more precise
            assessment of a company's true worth. This is because a company's
            profits serve as a more dependable sign of its financial prosperity
            compared to its sales revenue. The earnings multiplier accounts for
            the potential return on investment that may be achieved by investing
            cash flow at the prevailing interest rate throughout the same time
            frame, hence adjusting future profits. Put simply, it modifies the
            existing P/E ratio to factor in the prevailing interest rates.

            4. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method The Discounted Cash Flow
            (DCF) Method is a financial valuation technique. The DCF (Discounted
            Cash Flow) approach of company valuation has resemblance to the
            earnings multiplier. This approach relies on forecasting future cash
            flows and then adjusting them to get the present market value of the
            firm. The primary distinction between the discounted cash flow
            approach and the profit multiplier approach lies in the fact that
            the former incorporates inflation in its computation of the current
            value.

            5. Book Value The monetary value of a company's assets minus its
            liabilities, as shown on its balance sheet. Shareholders' equity
            refers to the value of a company's assets less its liabilities, as
            shown on the balance sheet statement. The book value is calculated
            by deducting the company's total liabilities from its total assets.

            6. Liquidation value Value of assets when they are sold quickly,
            usually at a discount, to generate cash for a company's creditors.
            The liquidation value refers to the amount of cash that a firm would
            get if it were to sell all its assets and settle all its debts
            immediately. This list does not include all of the company valuation
            methodologies currently in use. Additional approaches include
            replacement value, breakup value, asset-based valuation, and several
            more.
