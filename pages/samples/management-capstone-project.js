            Graybar Inc. is considered the largest distributor and supply chain
            business of various electrical, telecommunication, and industrial
            materials. It distributes items like telephone equipment, optical
            fiber cables, copper cables, various wireless products, etc. The
            company, which was created in 1869 by engineer Elisha Gray and
            businessman Enos Barton, is wholly controlled by its employees. In
            1872, Gray & Barton shifted their focus to Western Electric and
            moved to become the biggest manufacturer of telephones. This is the
            largest and probably the only company of its size employees owns.
            This study will focus on the current situation of the company based
            on a market overview. Graybar provides services to the industrial,
            corporate, governmental, public, utility, and residential
            industries. Graybar offerings help with building projects, capital
            projects, building renovations, servicing, restoration, management,
            and more. Also, the future goals of the company and the methods to
            be taken up will be evaluated. The Torq IT team collaborated with
            Graybar Canada to integrate marketing materials from thousands of
            goods and various data streams into a PIM application. They were
            enabled to develop a new program in collaboration with their data
            managers that assisted them in sorting all of their items into a new
            classification that is suitable for their impending E-commerce
            system.

            Jason Taylor was named Graybar Canada's Executive Vice President and
            General Manager in March 2019, just before Covid 19. Since then, the
            executive management team has evolved, and young comers have gained
            new roles. A matrix model underpins the Graybar layout. Geographical
            regions are used to service current customers. Client connections
            are kept up to date, and income is tracked at the provincial scale.
            Traditionally, Atlantic Canada was the highest income area, and it
            is currently equivalent in area to Central Canada, which has
            witnessed enormous expansion. Western Canada is the weakest region,
            although it will grow with the hiring of a new Managing Partner in
            2021. In 2021, the merger of a new strategic acquisition will also
            begin. The purchase of ElectroMag, a regional robotics supplier in
            the region of Qu√©bec, strengthens Graybar's footprint in Canada.
            National officials in selling, advertising, finance,
            telecommunications, stock, and management offer pass solutions to
            deal and direction to the areas. In 2021, a new key involvement
            Project Manager-was created in response to the growing national
            focus on innovation. Another significant institutional improvement
            was the founding of The Graybar Canada Innovation Council. This
            60-person unit was constituted to give approval and feedback to
            Graybar Canada's current holdings of reforms. The group represents a
            horizontal slice of Graybar. This new emerging group is formed up of
            both long-term employees and recent hires from diverse divisions and
            sectors. The team met just a few times in 2021 and started to gain
            concentration and pace.

            The company is currently facing several challenges in different
            sectors. COVID 19 pandemic had a huge impact on the growth of the
            company. Lockdown caused by the pandemic severely affected the sales
            rate of the company. The yearly revenue of the company decreased
            gradually during the pandemic time. Apart from that, the company is
            facing challenges with its supply network too. The supply chain is
            the biggest strength of this company which is now becoming a weak
            point for the organization. Due to poor performance, several outlets
            of the company are being closed currently.

            Graybar Canada first established an application delivery solution
            using a competing product. Nevertheless, as research and development
            ceased and the software no longer worked effectively with Windows
            8.1 and Windows 10, the IT staff struggled to handle the over 400
            concurrent users. Furthermore, the software-defined- defined
            solution could not be published on iOS or Android handheld
            platforms. Graybar Canada needed a software-defined- defined
            alternative that would provide instant, dependable distant access to
            enterprise resource planning (ERP) software programs on distant
            location desktop machines, portable devices, and fully responsive
            internet browsers to enact more customer-friendly, mobile-friendly
            cloud computing facilities. Connectivity to ERP systems on mobile
            devices enabled staff to have real-time inventory stock data in one
            place, enhancing customer experience and increasing corporate
            efficiency.

            During the COVID 19 viral outbreak and pandemic crisis throughout
            the world, Graybar Canada, like other firms, began to experience
            some obstacles that had not been encountered before. Many of the
            industry's stores were shuttered, and there was a great deal of
            anxiety in the industry's operating stores. With people all over the
            world choosing to purchase from the comfort of their own homes, the
            demand for e-commerce or search engine optimization was
            skyrocketing. Graybar Canada has since made investments more in the
            digitalization of its organization and has significantly enhanced
            its digital capabilities. Digital reforms enable any corporation to
            operate effectively even under the most difficult and essential
            conditions. In the context of virtual change, the responsibilities
            and potential of company leaders are enormous. The manager is
            responsible for integrating the appropriate tools and procedures in
            the firm's management system to carry out the firm's digitalization.
            They are also responsible for maintaining the company's staff and
            cultivating the workers' passion and commitment during the change
            time (Mwakisaghu,2019). Building particular teams, defining business
            goals, controlling customer support operations, and adopting
            transformational technology are all essential acts that executives
            must accomplish during the change. Along with the benefits and
            possibilities, there are other problems that leaders encounter
            during the digital revolution or disturbance. The major difficulty
            for leaders is sensing and detecting difficulties. Aside from that,
            selecting and implementing the most appropriate technology to
            alleviate the issues is critical. Leaders must even maintain a watch
            on market data and client ratings at the same time in order to make
            the best of difficult conditions. Another important difficulty for
            leaders throughout the digital revolution is planning and
            implementing digitized service to customers while retaining demand.
            t a few times and started to get concentration and momentum. Graybar
            began an effort in 2019 to develop an e-commerce system via which
            consumers may connect with Graybar immediately, especially
            purchasing things digitally. The radically altered various
            operations inside Graybar as well as for outside brand
            representatives. Salesforce was soon introduced by Graybar as a
            fresh Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. Graybar
            selected the virtual appliance solution to provide a more robust
            foundation for future growth. The current ERP system is out of date,
            and technical assistance is insufficient. The new Infor Cloud Suite
            is a slashing methodology built on industry best practices. Graybar
            will profit with a more extended version of its business and more
            nearly identical as a result of Infor Cloud Suite. The in-house ERP
            system currently includes various statistics that were created over
            time. Data will also be accessible through a self-service website.
            The computer software and navigation of both the software will be
            improved to make use of contemporary technology.

            According to the challenges and current scenario of the
            organization, Graybar , Canada it can be implemented that an
            effective change management plan should be incorporated within the
            organization to boost productivity which can aid in the process of
            innovation and also improve the growth and development of the
            company (Galli,2018). Although the company was one of the most
            renowned organizations dealing with electrical equipment combined
            with technology and softwares, the onset of the covid 19, affected
            the company's growth and operations. The company underwent a digital
            transformation, which also included certain drawbacks and affected
            the overall performance of the company. Hence, it has become
            effective that an immediate change management plan would help in
            building resilience, and restructure the organization by nurturing
            productivity in the new environment. This in turn would also assist
            in increasing the efficiencies of the employees and help them to
            perform better accomplishing the organizational goals. As this
            company is an employee-owned company, the roles and responsibilities
            are quite different from usual in this organization
            (Mwakisaghu,2019). About 700 employees of this company have all the
            rights and ability to buy shares in the organization. This is indeed
            a special characteristic of this company which makes this different
            from others of the same kind. There are numerous job titles and
            roles for the employees of this company. This feature of the company
            is one of the most significant aspects of change management which if
            implemented successfully by establishing an effective organizational
            hierarchy and hierarchical structure with an open communication
            system between the staff and the levels of management can prove to
            be beneficial for the betterment of the company. An effective change
            management plan includes the implementation of effective leadership
            approaches , and changes in the culture of the organization for
            increasing the productivity and performance of the employees along
            with identifying the specific areas which require more attention for
            improvements (Galli,2018). The company has been recognised for its
            innovative ideas and innovation which has enabled it to establish
            itself in the marketplace. But the pandemic has influenced Graybar
            and its employees to a great extent and they have become habituated
            with the modern habits of work culture. The employees to certain
            extent have also lost their creative thinking abilities which is one
            of the most significant reasons for the challenges. Although Graybar
            Canada was pleasantly surprised to see that implementing Parallels
            RAS elevated emulation technology only took just a few hours of IT
            personnel effort, the implementation of an effective change
            management plan would influence the organization to come up with
            better innovative ideas and solutions. Graybar Canada also profited
            from increased dependability and ERP accessibility from every gadget
            with Web connectivity. With the Parallels, RAS all-inclusive
            solution's automatic, the in-system extremely, the organization
            could quickly build a greater VM connectivity without the problems
            or expensive expenses involved with competing for virtualization
            development tools. Parallels RAS's continuous integration
            distribution assistance services Graybar Canada‚Äôs immediate access
            to ERP systems on just about any gadget, allowing the organization
            to keep superior control of authentic stock levels (Al-Lozi &
            Al-Qirem,2021). Parallels RAS provided excellent ERP software
            emulation, whereas the IT staff appreciated an incredibly simple
            infrastructure. Graybar should focus on developing a strong
            organizational culture and environment, with the assistance of an
            effective leadership approach like the transformational leadership
            approach which would influence the employees to remain motivated and
            engage in the process of creative thinking abilities to focus on
            innovation. A transformational leader is able to provide appropriate
            guidance to the employees which helps them to clear the role
            ambiguities, and develop high levels of job satisfaction. A high
            level of job satisfaction enables the employees to improve
            organizational commitment and hence they are able to actively
            participate and engage in the process of innovative thinking. The
            recent technology of Graybar which didn't work out with window 8.1
            or 10 , is a lack of efficiency and skill sets (Al-Lozi &
            Al-Qirem,2021). This skill set among the employees can be inculcated
            , with the help of appropriate training facilities from the
            management including both formal and informal learning
            opportunities, like coaching sessions, mentoring, gamification etc.
            Establishment of an effective communication system is also essential
            to impose any culture of new thinking within the organization.
            Graybar should focus on the implementation of an effective
            communication system which would highly acknowledge the two way
            communication system and provide more emphasis on the feedback
            system by various assessments and tools like , interviews,
            questionnaires, surveys , etc. This would enable the management to
            identify the gaps in the skillsets and also they would be able to
            conduct a training needs analysis (Alqatawenh,2018). The company
            should also focus on investing more in the research and development
            for better cost effective technologies and with higher efficiencies
            which are able to satisfy the customers. Graybar needs to implement
            this change management plan for stimulating the process of
            innovation which would help them to resolve the challenges and
            barriers affecting their company. Successful innovative ideas would
            assist the company to improve their performance and boost
            productivity thereby generating maximum revenues and accomplishing
            organizational goals.

            helping the cause of the organization and providing better outcomes
            for the company as well as for the customers. The company goes
            through a complicated job role system which can be simplified and
            improved for the betterment of the organization. This way the
