            Gross Domestic Product (GDP) refers to the total value of all goods
            and services produced inside a country's borders over a certain
            period of time. Gross domestic product (GDP) is a widely used metric
            that quantifies the economic well-being of a nation and serves as a
            gauge of its overall quality of life. Furthermore, GDP serves as a
            means to assess and contrast the levels of production across various
            nations. An eminent benefit of GDP is its consistency in
            computations across different countries. Therefore, doing a
            comparison across nations yields a significant degree of precision.
            Moreover, GDP serves as an indicator of economic development or
            contraction and the growth or collapse of an economy. The World
            Bank, the United Nations, and the International Monetary Fund are
            among the several organisations that gather and provide statistics
            about GDP estimates across all nations.

            Nominal GDP Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measured at current prices,
            without adjusting for inflation is Nominal GDP. Nominal GDP refers
            to the measurement of GDP using the current market prices. Nominal
            GDP is not adjusted for inflation, it is probable that the
            statistics provided are greater than the estimates for real GDP.

            Gross Domestic Product per Capita (Purchasing Power Parity) GDP per
            capita is a metric that quantifies the overall economic production
            of a nation. It is computed by dividing the country's GDP for a
            certain time, often one year, by the average total population during
            that period. Per capita GDP is often used as a metric to gauge
            living standards and the efficiency of a nation's labour force. GDP
            per capita, calculated using purchasing power parity (PPP), is
            estimated by PPP calculations. Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) enables
            the comparison of the quality of life and earnings across various
            nations, while accounting for variations in price levels within each
            country.

            Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per Hour Worked Gross Domestic Product
            (GDP) per hour worked serves as a measure of a nation's labour
            productivity. It quantifies the degree of efficiency in which labour
            is integrated with other components and used in the process of
            production. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per hour worked is
            determined by dividing the actual output by the total number of
            hours worked, which serves as a measure of labour input.
