            Woolworths Supermarket is a well-established supermarket chain in
            Australia, with a presence throughout a substantial portion of the
            country's industrial background. This report will illustrate the
            many characteristics and repercussions of globalisation on
            businesses. The business's history, present operations, tenure,
            intriguing facts, and basics of future approach have all been
            described in detail (Woolworths Group Ltd., 2021). The study focuses
            on Woolworth's operations and supply chain procedures, with a focus
            on how successfully they have (or haven't) dealt with the pandemic's
            issues and what they may have learned that might help them be better
            equipped to deal with a highly disruptive event in the future. With
            so much information, it will be easier to provide a clear and
            complete picture of a broad range of organisational criteria.
            Condensing content from several credible sources resulted in the
            creation of several sections. Operations management is a critical
            component of a company's organisational structure, translating
            inputs and raw materials into a recognisable physical produced
            product for customers, as in Woolworth's instance. Productivity is
            significantly influenced by internal organisational structures.
            Oversees the integration of general operations systems,
            manufacturing operations, and people to manage productivity via
            operational factors. The supply chain connects operations related to
            the transfer of raw materials and the creation of the end product to
            offer customers tangible things to buy. Consumer demands are met
            in-store, ensuring that stock is taken care of on a regular basis to
            keep the supply chain moving smoothly into the shop (Parliament of
            Australia, 2020). This may range from production planning to
            customer service, which is both easy and effective. By supplying
            services and commodities that meet client expectations, the value
            chain increases consumer value. Operational management establishes
            an internal structure that team members must follow in order to meet
            the organization's objectives (Woolworths Group Ltd., 2021). They
            determine the talents and resources available to the organisation in
            order to enhance the final goal's development. Value chain
            management is used by Woolworths Group Ltd's operations management
            system, which evaluates existing skills to see whether the value is
            required. COVID 19 boosted sales, but it also had a huge influence
            on the supply chain, hurting customer happiness and availability.

            The retail business is fast gaining speed to give favourably to the
            overall perspective as a result of continuous economic and social
            advancements, including vigorous economic growth, growing buying
            power, and expanding population. According to
            Mordorintelligence.com, Australia's retail business will expand by
            2% during the next five years, from 2013 to 2018. (2017). Given that
            Australia's retail business is the second smallest in the Asia
            Pacific (ASPAC) region, such a pace of growth suggests that the
            industry needs significant improvement (Veselovská, 2020). The
            country's condition market is very volatile, suggesting that a major
            uptick or downtick might occur at any time. Low loan rates, along
            with a rise in people's discretionary income, could assist the
            industry flourish more swiftly. Regardless of the industry's slow
            development, trading has done well, especially internet sales, which
            have increased significantly in recent years. Since low lending
            rates and the development of household credit promote consumers to
            splurge, the industry has turn out to be more price-economical while
            offering buyers the most accessibility (Powell, 2021). Woolworths
            Group Limited, Australia's well-known food and grocery retailer, was
            founded in 1924 and opened its first shop in Sydney three years
            later, during the Great Depression. Introducing the well-known
            "Fresh Food People" campaign, which debuted in 1987 and quickly
            became a publicly re-listed stock market in 1993, obtaining "96
            percent of all fresh fruit and vegetables and 100 percent of fresh
            meat" (www.woolworthsgroup.com.au, n.d.). With more than 215,000
            workers nationally, Australia's second-biggest food and stapling
            chain are currently regarded as one of the country's major food and
            stapling businesses. Woolworths (WOW) has a share price of $39.63,
            according to the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX - WOW WOOLWORTHS
            GROUP LIMITED 2021). The impact of COVID 19 on the company's share
            prices from 2020 until now has been revealed by ASX (WOWs)
            (Parliament of Australia, 2020).

            Political factors are essential to consider when evaluating the
            factors that may have an influence on Woolworths Limited's long-time
            viability in each country or market. Woolworths Limited works in the
            Food & Staples Retailing industry in more than a dozen countries,
            revealing it to a range of political risks (Knight, 2021). To
            succeed in such a vibrant Food & Staples Retailing industry across
            several countries, it is vital to expand the systemic risks of the
            political atmosphere. Woolworths Limited may carefully consider
            factors such as the importance of the food and staples retailing
            business in the country's economy, political stability, the threat
            of military invasion, levels of corruption, chiefly in the Food and
            Staples Retailing industry, government administration, and
            involvement in the food and staples retailing industry before
            entering or investing in a market. Woolworths also takes care of
            contract execution legal framework, intellectual property
            protection, food and Staples Retailing Trade Regulations and
            Tariffs, preferred corporate associates, antitrust laws about food
            and staples retailing, rates of taxation and incentives, wage
            legislature, such as the minimum remuneration and overtime pay, food
            and Staples Retailing Workweek Regulations, and employee perks that
            are required (Macau, 2022).

            Despite government interference in free markets and the food and
            staples sector of the economy, various economic views are blooming,
            allowing Woolworths to develop profitably. Australia and New Zealand
            are both economically stable, with a good quality of living, which
            helps the company's retail sales accelerate. According to the World
            Economic Outlook 2018 of the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
            Australia's GDP is among the top twenty in the world, representing
            considerable growth potential for merchants (Hobbs, 2021). Customers
            prefer organic products provided by retailers with a green tag.
            Sociocultural Environment – People of all demographic levels prefer
            firms that offer environmentally friendly products and services, and
            many customers choose organic products provided by retailers with a
            green tag. Woolworths recognises this trend and is dedicated to
            supplying 'green' items while also being a leader in fostering a
            better standard of living (Sallis, Owen and Fisher 2015). Woolworths
            has recognized various sustainability programmes and efforts all
            over the years to deal with variations in the socio-cultural
            environment, including its sustainability plan 2007-15 (Kaye and
            Sridharan, 2022).
