            1. Prioritise sustainable sourcing and ethical practices: Marks &
            Spencer's success is built on its dedication to obtaining materials
            in a sustainable manner and doing business in an ethical way. M&S
            has been at the forefront of championing ecologically sustainable
            and socially conscious projects. The firm prioritises responsible
            procurement, fair labour methods, and minimising its environmental
            impact. This dedication not only corresponds to the increasing
            customer need for sustainable goods but also improves M&S's brand

            3. The process of using digital technology to revolutionise business
            operations and the buying and selling of goods and services online:
            Marks & Spencer has made deliberate investments in digital
            transformation and e-commerce skills in order to adapt to the
            digital revolution. The organisation acknowledges the significance
            of adopting an omnichannel strategy, which ensures that consumers
            have a smooth and integrated purchasing experience both online and
            offline. This not only accommodates the evolving demands of
            technologically knowledgeable customers but also broadens M&S's
            market penetration, making a substantial contribution to overall
            profitability and sustainability.

            These include customised shopping experiences, prompt customer
            assistance, and loyalty programmes. Marks & Spencer's focus on
            customer satisfaction not only helps them keep their current
            consumers, but also brings in new ones, which contributes to their
